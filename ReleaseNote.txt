----------------------------
    RELEASE NOTE
----------------------------
This release V-1.3.0 includes new features and major bug fixes to version V-1.2.2
in compliance with the openPOWERLINK Specification EPSG DS-301 v1.1.


----------------------------
       BEHAVIOR
----------------------------
1) The projects created and saved with version V-1.2.0 and above can be used with this version.
2) It is highly recommended to upgrade the projects built using previous versions
 of openCONFIGURATOR to this version.
3) In Windows, it is recommended to use only 32 bit binaries of ActiveTCL version 8.5.

----------------------------
     NEW-FEATURES
----------------------------
1) XML - Schema validation for the imported XDD's.
2) Support for 64 bit objects (UINT64, INT64).
3) Support for nested datatypes in a parameter.
4) Size of PI increased from 4064 to 65536 bytes.
5) Added dropdown boxes for PDO mapping in autogenerate mode.
    Note:
    - The values in the length column will be 1 byte(0x0008) for the complex
	   datatypes and domain objects.
      Workaround:
       1) Set Auto Generate to 'No'.
       2) Update the mapping with the required values.
       3) Then set Auto Generate to 'Yes' 
       4) Build the project to generate the CDC.
6) Added Doxygen documentation.
7) Source compilation with CMake for Linux and Windows.

----------------------------
      BUG FIXES
----------------------------
1) CN is allowed to have more than one TPDO.
2) Mapping size and length is not validated during build process.
3) Errors in the names of the PI subindices of MN.
4) Error while deleting a CN after it is autogenerated.
5) Maximum number of MN channels exceeded error.
6) TPDO and RPDO objects are allowed to be mapped to RPDO and TPDO indices.
7) MN PDO indices are deleted when CN has zero PDOs.
8) Number of entries updated while editing the PDO objects using graphical PDO mapping table.
9) PDO mapping property for subindices are not saved in 'octx' files.
10) Maximum payload size not validated.
11) Empty actual value present in the CDC.
12) MN PRes set to 'on' by default.
13) Incorrect number.of entries value in CDC.
14) Values input by user in 0x1F81 subindices are not reflecting in CDC in autogenerate 'off' mode.
15) Stability issues from user crash reports.
16) Fix memory leak issues.


------------------------------
  KNOWN ISSUES and WORK AROUND
------------------------------
1) In Windows only 32 bit is supported, install only Tcl/Tk 32 bit version
2) In Linux 64 bit version if faced with a segmentation fault, could be due to error in tk 8.5
   reported at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=728313
    1. Download and install the latest Tcl/Tk installer for Linux 64 bit
       from http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads (tested with v8.5.14)
       TCL default installation path: "/opt/ActiveTcl-8.5"
    2. Add the path to folder which contains the binary wish8.5 to the environment PATH
        export PATH=<path-to-folder-containing-binary-wish8.5>:$PATH
        export PATH=/opt/ActiveTcl-8.5/bin:$PATH
    Suggestion:
        Add the command to file ~/.bashrc to automatically set PATH on system bootup.
3) MN PRes and PReq cannot be configured for simultaneous reception by a CN.
4) Skipping of offset is not allowed for PDO mapping.
   Workaround:
    1) Set Auto Generate to 'No'.
    2) Create the CN and MN mapping with the required values.
    3) Build the project to generate the CDC.
