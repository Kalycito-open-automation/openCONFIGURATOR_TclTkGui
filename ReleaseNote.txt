----------------------------
    RELEASE NOTE
----------------------------
This release V-1.3.1 includes minor bug fixes on version V-1.3.0
in compliance with the openPOWERLINK Specification EPSG DS-301 v1.1.


----------------------------
       BEHAVIOR
----------------------------
1) The projects created and saved with version V-1.2.0 and above can be used with this version.
2) It is highly recommended to upgrade the projects built using previous versions
 of openCONFIGURATOR to this version.
3) In Windows, it is recommended to use only 32 bit binaries of ActiveTCL version 8.5.

----------------------------
      BUG FIXES
----------------------------
1) Generation of incorrect CDC for multiplexed CNs
2) CN objects 0x1C0B/0x1C0C/0c1C0D subObject 0x3 not written to CDC
3) Non-Unique channel names in xap.xml
4) Incorrectly calculated MN mapping for channels which exceeds 252 bytes
5) Heap corruption for node id's > 99


------------------------------
  KNOWN ISSUES and WORK AROUND
------------------------------
1) In Windows only 32 bit is supported, install only Tcl/Tk 32 bit version
2) In Linux 64 bit version if faced with a segmentation fault, could be due to error in tk 8.5
   reported at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=728313
    1. Download and install the latest Tcl/Tk installer for Linux 64 bit
       from http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads (tested with v8.5.14)
       TCL default installation path: "/opt/ActiveTcl-8.5"
    2. Add the path to folder which contains the binary wish8.5 to the environment PATH
        export PATH=<path-to-folder-containing-binary-wish8.5>:$PATH
        export PATH=/opt/ActiveTcl-8.5/bin:$PATH
    Suggestion:
        Add the command to file ~/.bashrc to automatically set PATH on system bootup.
3) MN PRes and PReq cannot be configured for simultaneous reception by a CN.
4) Skipping of offset is not allowed for PDO mapping.
   Workaround:
    1) Set Auto Generate to 'No'.
    2) Create the CN and MN mapping with the required values.
    3) Build the project to generate the CDC.
