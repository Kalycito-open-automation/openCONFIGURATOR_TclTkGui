<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Powerlink is an open, Ethernet based industrial
field bus technology that guarantees deterministic data transfer even
for high bandwidth applications. Apart from its real-time data
handling capabilities, Powerlink can also be best described by the
statement “Powerlink = CANOpen over Ethernet” as the
configuration layers of Powerlink are designed to benefit from the
Standard device profiles specified in CANopen EN 50325-4 for
automation.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>Though
Powerlink is extremely open and it brings together the advantages of
both Ethernet and CANOpen, it demands a certain degree of expertise
in Ethernet and CANOpen for the users of this technology, for e.g.
they may have to understand the Powerlink Object Dictionary and may
have to understand the index, sub-indexes and PDO mappings before
they can see meaningful data exchange between their nodes.
openCONFIGURATOR is designed to eliminate this need and enable an
uninitiated user of Ethernet and CANOpen to configure and run a
Powerlink network in a very short time. At the same time, for an
experienced user, the tool offers complete control over the
configuration in each stage of the build process. openCONFIGURATOR is
also designed to run on both Linux and Windows. </FONT>
